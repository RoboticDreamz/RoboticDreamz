## Question and Answers:

### **What made you become a programmer?**
These all stemmed from my childhood. Growing up in the 2000s, I saw how websites looked so cool back then and those 1-hour free trial games were also my inspiration.

So I went to actually learn programming online. Now, I'm trying to make my childhood wishes come to life.

### What are the projects you're working on?
As of now, I'm working on a pixel art point-and-click game called  **Patsy n' Crinkles**. Though I'm also working on side projects such as **Why Foxy?** or **Mint Teenz**.
